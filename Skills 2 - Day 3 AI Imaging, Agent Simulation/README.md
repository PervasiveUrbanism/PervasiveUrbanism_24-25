# VVVV - Computer Vision 

## Intro VVVV
Overview of the platform and the computational concepts it is built upon. Introduction to its main libraries ([Skia](https://skia.org/),[Stride](https://www.stride3d.net/),[fuse](https://www.thefuselab.io/)) and their functionalities. Typical use cases and notable reference projects, including works by [Refik Anadol](https://refikanadol.com/), [Schnelle Bunte Bilder](), and [Marshmallow Laser Feast](https://marshmallowlaserfeast.com/). A comparison with similar software, such as TouchDesigner, and an outline of the available licensing options. 
## Skia
-Drawing simple shapes (Rectanges, lines )
## Computational grammar
-Datsatypes, loops etc. 
## OpenCV
-Opening camera streams and pictures  
-NDI  
-Slit screen example
