# 2. Learning Resources

## LinkedIn Learning  
With your UCL account, you can access courses on [LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com) for free. Here are some recommended courses:  
- **Rhino 7 Essential Training**: A beginner's guide to Rhino.  
- **Rhino: From Curves to Surface**: Intermediate techniques for organic modeling.  
- **Grasshopper Essential Training**: An introduction to Grasshopper.  
- **Grasshopper: Generative Design for Architecture**: Intermediate Grasshopper techniques.  
- **Become an Arduino Developer**: A learning path for Arduino beginners.  
- **Python Essential Training**: A beginner’s guide to Python.

Please watch these tutorials and familiarize yourself with the content. While the skills tutorials will cover Python and Arduino, they won’t cover a beginner introduction on Rhino or Grasshopper. *Additionally, being somewhat familiar with the content beforehand will make it easier to follow along with the skills modules.*

## O'Reilly  
[O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) offers similar resources to LinkedIn Learning but with a focus on computing. Free for UCL students, it provides a vast range of books and video tutorials, making it a valuable resource for more advanced topics.

## Rhino / Grasshopper  
Download the [user manuals](https://www.rhino3d.com/en/tutorials/) and watch the tutorial videos.  
For Grasshopper, here’s a [selection of learning resources](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/tutorials-1). Most are free, but I recommend Modelab’s PDF and resources from Zubin Khabazi.  

Consider buying *Arturo Tedeschi's "AAD, Algorithms-Aided Design: Parametric Strategies Using Grasshopper"*, a great book with practical examples.  

Check out the [YouTube channel of Jose Sanchez](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5dMacit2C5fYiS4lMNq3ow) for excellent, though slightly dated, tutorials.  
Also, explore this site for [random Rhino/Grasshopper tips and tricks](http://runxel.xyz/rhino-secrets/).

## Python  
The internet is packed with Python learning resources. The offer of LinkedIn Learning should be sufficient. That said, here is a curated selection of tried-and-tested recommendations:
- *“Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”* is a beginner-friendly book available for purchase or free [online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc).  
- For quick reference, check out [W3Schools Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).

## Arduino
**"Exploring Arduino"** by Jeremy Blum  
An ideal introduction to Arduino, blending hands-on electronics with programming fundamentals.

**"Programming Arduino: Getting Started with Sketches"** by Simon Monk — Intermediate  
A fantastic resource for Arduino programming, providing in-depth insights into C language and microcontroller functions. Perfect for those wanting to advance their coding skills in Arduino.

**"Programming Arduino, Next Steps"** by Simon Monk — Advanced  
This book covers efficient coding techniques to run an Arduino on a single battery for extended periods, utilizing every tool to optimize performance. *Not* particularly relevant for RC15, it’s an outstanding guide (like all of Monk's work) for maximizing Arduino’s capabilities.

## 4. Additional Software Packages and Web Services  

### QGIS  
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/index.html) is a free, open-source GIS tool for working with maps, satellite images, shapefiles, and databases. It supports numerous formats and exports as DXF or PDF files. Although powerful, it is mostly 2D, and its interface may not be as polished as some commercial alternatives like ArcGis.

- **Plug-ins:**  
   Available through the QGIS Plugin Manager:
   - **Flickr Metadata Downloader:** Search and download geotagged Flickr images.
   - **Mmqgis:** Tools for hexagons and Voronoi diagrams.
   - **QuickOSM:** Download OpenStreetMap data.
   - **Time Series:** Create and export animations.
   - **TravelTime Platform Plugin:** Perform network analysis.
   - **QNEAT3:** Network analysis.
  
[Patrick Stotz’s QGIS 101](https://github.com/PatrickStotz/mapping_101) is a good starting point for learning QGIS.  

Additionally, the official documentation is very useful:  
- [Gentle Introduction to GIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html)  
- [Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)
