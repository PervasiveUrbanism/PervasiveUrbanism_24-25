# SKILLS MODULES

## HACKNING THE IOT 
The module focuses on designing a wearable prototype that serves as a prosthetic interface connecting you to the urban environment. Using microcontrollers and Arduino, we will create sensors and actuators that can communicate with each other. GPS will enable time and location tracking, while events can either be logged or transmitted directly to a computer. Additionally, we will explore methods for preparing files in Rhino for laser cutting and 3D printing. We'll also cover 2D data visualization techniques in Python to represent the recorded data.

## REPRESENTING CITY DYNAMICS 
The series of workshops explores 3D city mapping and visualisation techniques, demonstrating how to visualise, edit, analyse, and create mesh models from point clouds. We will explore a range of 3D scanning methods, including machine learning-based depth estimation with Nerfs and Gaussian splattering, basic photogrammetry using smartphones, and professional 3D scanners available for rent from UCL. Additionally, the workshop will cover data visualisation techniques within Rhino/Grasshopper, exploring Grasshopper libraries for working with maps, running simulations, and optimisation through evolutionary algorithms.

## DATAMINING THE CITY 
In this module we will explore desktop-based data-mining techniques, beginning with publicly accessible data sources like the London Datastore and learning how to visualize various file formats. Further, we’ll examine web APIs from platforms such as TfL, Flickr, and Google Maps, and learn how to extract the necessary data programmatically. For websites without dedicated APIs, we’ll cover data scraping methods using the web browser. We will apply text and image-based sentiment analysis, along with machine learning techniques for object recognition on the collected data. The tasks of this module will primarily be carried out using Python, Rhino, and Illustrator.

## Github
We will use this GitHub page for storing and distributing sample codes, links, recordings, and other materials related to the skills modules. Updates will be made to this page regularly throughout the year. You have the option to clone this repository to your computer and update it regularly. We will use a small portion of the total functionality and if you're unfamiliar with GitHub, it would be best to install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and to have a look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) for more information.

# INDUCTIONS

## B Made
[B Made](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/about/our-locations-and-facilities/b-made-bartlett-workshops) provides access to their laser cutter and printer. For details on file preparation, refer to the [B Made Moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=39723&section=0#tabs-tree-start). The model workshop and tools are also available for use after completing an [induction](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=39723&section=1#tabs-tree-start).

[B Made](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=39723&section=46#tabs-tree-start) additionally offers rentals for 3D scanners and cameras. A separate induction is required before renting these items.
